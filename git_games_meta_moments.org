* Meta Momements
I had a bit of a meta moment while swimming today. I have a lot of
good moments while swimming, probably because it's a chance for my
mind to wander.  That's probably a good argument to go more often than
I did this past week.  But I digress.

Yesterday I was introduced to a [[ http://pcottle.github.com/learnGitBranching/][game of sorts]] to help learn some
concepts used by [[http://git-scm.com/about][git]].  For those of you who don't know, git is a
versioning control system that has gained quit a bit of popularity
over the past few years, especially in the open source community.  I
had been using it myself for my own projects, but mainly at a very
simplistic level.
