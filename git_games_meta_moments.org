* Meta Momements
I had a bit of a meta moment while swimming today. I have a lot of
good moments while swimming, probably because it's a chance for my
mind to wander.  That's probably a good argument to go more often than
I did this past week.  But I digress.

Yesterday I was introduced to a [[ http://pcottle.github.com/learnGitBranching/][game of sorts]] to help learn some
concepts used by [[http://git-scm.com/about][git]].  For those of you who don't know, git is a
versioning control system that has gained quit a bit of popularity
over the past few years, especially in the open source community.  I
had been using it myself for my own projects, but mainly at a very
simplistic level.

At a basic level a versioning control system (VCS), of which git is
one of many, is a tool to facilitate documenting the changes
of... well, a document. Historically these systems were develped by
software designers to both document changes and provide an easy path
to revert to older versions of source code. Later, similar concepts
were implemented in modern word processors (with limited scope and
power due to the restrictive nature, essentially the traditional
method of tracking edits from the pen and paper days was ported over
to the electronic medium without much change).
