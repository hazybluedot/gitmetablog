Are we all Ice Skaters?

Gliding through life, blissfully unaware that there is an entirely different world just below the surface.

The times we do break through unexpectedly the shock is so much that it often kills us.

And so we learn to fear thin ice. It is dangerous.  It leads to death (some would say the /ultimate/ price).

When we do decide to tap into the world on the other side we use tools to drill a controlled hole through the boundary.

We remain on the surface, in our own element. Comfortable.

We lower more tools through the chasm, to fish out the pieces of that underworld we are interested in, because we understand that it can help sustain our own life, on the surface.

And when we have extracted what we think we need, we leave the opening to seal up. 

A distortion and blemish on our surface that skaters learn to avoid, because it can trip them.
