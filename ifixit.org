#+TITLE: iBreakIt, iFixit

This past weekend ended up being the weekend of repairs as two lingering problems increased to a point that they could no longer be ignored:

1. The drain pipe of my bathroom sink completely detached itself from the sink basin.
2. The aluminum frame on the display of my laptop began peeling away
   from the LCD panel to such an extend that I was concerned continued
   use could result in cracking the front glass.

I will spare you, dear reader, the gory details of the fix to the
first problem (it involved a trip to the hardware store, some
plumber's puddy and an old tooth brush) and instead focus on the
latter.

As is usually the case with these things, my trusted laptop had long
since left its comfortable status of "covered under warrentee" when
this issue began, and while some googling revealed that
[[https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3717857?start%3D0&tstart%3D0][I
am not the only one]] to experiece this phenomenon it seemed I wasn't
going to get much loving care from Apple and I was fairly certain they
would have made some silly claim that they couldn't do anything for
the clearly mechanical problem because I was running Linux on my
machine, instead of OS X (full disclosure, they probably would have
been justified saying so in this case: one hypothesises cause of this
problem is excessive heating of the upper left corner which breaks
down the glue holding the aluminum backing to the LCD panel.  While a
number of non-blasphemous, OS-X users clearly had the same problem, my
case certainly isn't helped by the fact that two of the things that
don't always work out-of-the-box on a new
[[http://www.archlinux.org][Arch Linux]] install on a MBP are the fan
control software and "sleep on lid close". As a result, there have
been a number of times my laptop has overheated after I pulled it out
of my bag to discover it had never gone to sleep when I put it in.
Plus, I've definitely dropped the thing a number of times, as the
dents and scratches indicate. Woops.  That all being said (warning:
tangent alert), I was told of another experience in which an Apple
tech rep thought perhaps there was a virus after seeing a [[http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php/The_Syslinux_Project][syslinux]]
boot screen pop up[fn:genius]. 

[fn:genius] It does make you wonder
[[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/genius][what
dictionary]] Apple's marketing department was using when they came up
with the "Genius" title. A more accurate title, with 100% more
alliteration, would have been "Apple Automaton" since they do an
excellent job when a problem is solvable by means of a pre-supplied
checklist). Don't get me wrong, I think Apple's tech support is
generally pretty good, as are their employees. And they are completely
within their right to refuse to offer any service or advise to
customers who have opted out of the software/hardware-as-one package
they provide. But it doesn't (shouldn't) take a genius to determine that a
different bootloader from Apple's default is not a virus.

It would have cost $60 to have the nice folks at the campus bookstore
take a look at it, not including any repair costs.  The
Apple-sanctioned "fix" for this is a full replacement of the display
assembly (which seems silly since there's really nothing wrong with
the display), costing around $400-$600, depending on who you talk to
(or apparently $1000 if you're dealing with Australian dollars).  Long
story short[fn:toolate: too late], I decided I didn't have much to
lose[fn:whattolose aside from possibly rendering my display useless],
and some substantial costs to be saved if I attempted a DIY fix.

Now, let me be very clear: The fact that I happen to have a degree
that says "Computer Systems Engineering" in the title has little to no
bearing on my skill set and knowledge base required for this repair.
Honestly (and those of you who are currently pursuing a CpE degree,
please reassure the non-engineers that this is the truth).  I say this
because it is important that everyone know they are fully capable of
making many of their own repairs to there various pieces of
technology[fn:concequences: if you have ever replaced a tire on your
car, but freak out at the idea of fixing your own computer, breifly
consider the consequences of a botched repair job on
both. Statistically you are much more likely to die in a horrible,
fiery crash as the result of a bad tire replacement than a botched
attempt at regluing your laptop screen together.  Just something to
think about.].  The topic of technological elitism came up last year
in a [[http://www.gedi.vt.edu/][GEDI]] course, there is concern that
as we integrate more and more technology into our lives we are
becoming more and more dependent on those who understand how the
technology works.  My counter argument to that concern is that while
there certainly /is/ more to learn and more skills involved in the
service and repair of a computer than say, a pen and paper, there are
many excellent resources freely available to anyone who takes the
initiative to learn about them.  One great resource that I used for
this particular repair is ifixit.com, a wiki-based repair manual
containing step-by-step guides for everything from
[[http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Repairing%2BFarberware%2BFSTO100%2BDoor%2BHandle/11490/1][replacing
the door handle on a toaster oven]] to various repairs of your
[[http://www.ifixit.com/Device/Phone][smartphone]].  Since I knew if I
had any chance of pulling this off I would need to lay the display
flat, the guide I found most relevant to the endeavor at hand was

1. Follow the steps in the ifixit guide to remove the display assembly from the body of the laptop.
2. Reset donut
3. attempt to apply epoxy in gap between aluminum backing and display, apply pressure, wait for a couple hours
4. reassemble laptop, power on and use
5. determine that epoxy is not holding, either due to age, bad application due to limited access to the surface
6. powerdown and re-disassemble laptop
7. Using a heat gun to loosen the remaining adhesive around the display casing, gently pry off the aluminum backing completely
8. This is a perfect opportunity to "pimp your mac" and add some sort of creative graphic behind the apple logo. All I could find was some engineering paper, which turned out somewhat ho-hum.
9. attempt to remove old adhesive with acetone and/or mechanical force. give up.
10. Working quickly, (it is 5 minute epoxy, after all) mix up a fresh batch of epoxy, apply intelligently around edge of display casing, choosing places that look least likely to cause problems if it runs over (e.g. avoid iSight camera housing)
11. Carefully position aluminum backing back on display casing, press firmly and wipe away excess epoxy.
12. Apply gentle pressure for 5-10 minutes, let cure for another hour or so before reassembly.

13. Re-assemble.
14. success!
