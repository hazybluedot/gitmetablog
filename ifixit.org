#+TITLE: iBreakIt, iFixit

This past weekend ended up being the weekend of repairs as two lingering problems increased to a point that they could no longer be ignored:

1. The drain pipe of my bathroom sink completely detached itself from the sink basin.
2. The aluminum frame on the display of my laptop began peeling away
   from the LCD panel to such an extend that I was conserned continued
   use could result in cracking the front glass.

I will spare you, dear reader, the gory details of the fix to the
first problem (it involved a trip to the hardware store, some
plumber's puddy and an old tooth brush) and instead focus on the
latter.
